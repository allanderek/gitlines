gitlines
========

A simple script to plot the number of lines within a github repository over commits.
The idea is to at least make a project aware that it is becoming larger,
that is, the number of lines of code (and other stuff) is increasing.

I intend to use this to try to make sure that projects do not becoming unmanageably large.
One could imagine other uses as well though.
